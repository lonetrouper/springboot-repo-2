mysql-client is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because it conflicts with mysql (which contains client libraries).

If you need to have mysql-client first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql-client you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/include"

local docker mysql setup : 

docker run -d --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root-password -v /Users/prtsh/Documents/docker-configurations/mysql-storage:/var/lib/mysql mysql
